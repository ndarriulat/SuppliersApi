# SuppliersApi
Simple .NET Core project with some simple CRUD operations and persistency using EF. 

The api is meant for a shop that works with several providers and needs to register its products with their correspondent prices.

## TODOs
This are the most urgent next steps for this project:
- Unit testing, taking the advantage of having dependency injection
- Repository classes, which would decouple the Services classes from the DB
- Add more basic features: ordering a new product, updating a product price, displaying all products from a provider
